# Human-Activity-Recognition
This repository presents the final project for a Machine Learning for IoT course, focusing on Human Activity Recognition (HAR). We implement and compare three distinct machine learning models applied to a comprehensive human activity dataset. The models showcase diverse approaches to accurately classify and predict human activities, providing valuable insights into the application of machine learning in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) for enhanced activity monitoring and understanding.
